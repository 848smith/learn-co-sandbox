# PokemonCLI

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install PokemonCLI

## Usage

TODO: This gem lets you search and get information on different pokemon. The API is using a gem that makes the API easier to use. It pulls information from the API site into nested hash. Then it takes that hash and creates objects in order to better call on the data. Finally, in the CLI it is fully built out so that way all you have to do is interpolate the data into a string to present it to the user. Then it runs a "edited_display" to basically have you pick another selection.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
